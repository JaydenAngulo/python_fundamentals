#CONCEPTS VARIABLES

taco = "Hello world"

password = "Shell$5"
email = "angulo20293386@student.nhvweb.net"
print("Password: ", password)
print("Email: ", email)

temperature = 72.5
print(type(temperature))
price = 3.99

enabled = False
is_complete = True
print(is_complete)
enabled = True
print(enabled)

# for math problems:

x = 3.14
y = 7
print(x + y)

# variables are flexible. you create or update another variable, like so:
count = 10
print(count)
count_down = count - 1
print(count_down)
count = count_down
print(count)
count_down = count - 1
print(count_down)
count = count_down
print(count)

# Challenge 1: Rename Variables
# Change the varable names x, y, z below to more descriptive names.

Name = "Radia Perlman"
Age = 34
Occupation = "Networking Engineer"

# Challenge 2: Update Variables
# Create a variable called 'count' with a value of 10.
# Increase it by 5 and print the result.
# Use two variables total.

count = 10
added_number = 5
print(count + added_number)

# Challenge 3: Swap Variables
# Given variables x = 4 and y = "hello"
# Swap the values so that x = "hello" and y = 4. Use a temporary variable.
# Hint: You will need to create one new variable.

x = 4
y = "hello"
temp = y
y = x
x = temp
print("x = ", x)
print("y = ", y)

# Challenge 4: Boolean Practice
# Create a variable named 'is_raining' set to False.
# On the next line, change it to True.
# Print "Is it raining?" followed by the boolean.

is_raining = False
print("Is it raining?: ", is_raining)
is_raining = True
print("Is it raining?: ", is_raining)
